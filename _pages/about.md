I am currently a PhD candidate of the Land Environment Resources and Health (LERH) PhD program, performing my reasearch at the Department of Land, Environment, Agriculture and Forestry (the acronym is TESAF in Italian) of the University of Padua. 

Since 2022 my research interests cover the applications of Machine Learning (Deep Learning, in particular) to Precision Agriculture.

From  2008 to 2014 I carried research activity in the foundations of Computer Science. I studied the formalisms of functional calculi like the Lambda Calculus in its various forms and flavors (typed and untyped, with resources, differential, etc.) both from the syncactical and the semantical point of view. Lambda Calculi are at the core of the concept of computation and the scientific approach to modern Computer Science relies on them. I also studied concurrent computational systems, like Petri Nets, and the formalization of confidentiality properties therein, together with their model checking.

This website is the result of forking the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
