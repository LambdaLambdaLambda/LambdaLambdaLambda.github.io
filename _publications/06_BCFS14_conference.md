Among the unsolvable terms of the lambda calculus, the mute (or root-active) ones are those having the highest degree of undefinedness. In this paper, we define an infinite set S of mute terms, and show that it is graph-easy: for any closed term t of the lambda calculus
there exists a graph model equating all the terms of S to t.
