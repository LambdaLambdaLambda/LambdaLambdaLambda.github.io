Answering a question by Honsell and Plotkin, we show that there are two equations between
lambda-terms, the so-called subtractive equations, consistent with lambda-calculus but not satisfied in any partially ordered model with bottom element. We also relate the subtractive equations to the open problem of the order-incompleteness of lambda-calculus.
