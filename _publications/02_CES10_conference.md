We initiate a purely algebraic study of Ehrhard and Regnier's resource lambda-calculus, by introducing three equational classes of algebras: resource combinatory algebras, resource lambda-algebras and resource lambda-abstraction algebras. We establish the relations between them, laying down foundations for a model theory of resource lambda-calculus. We also show that the ideal completion of a resource combinatory (resp. lambda-, lambda-abstraction) algebra induces a "classical" combinatory (resp. lambda-, lambda-abstraction) algebra, and that any model of the classical lambda-calculus raising from a resource lambda-algebra determines a lambda-theory which equates all terms having the same Bohm tree.
