The paper "Easy terms are not always simple" (2010) by myself and prof. Antonino Salibra solves problem 19 of the [TLCA list](https://newyork.craigslist.org/d/missed-connections/search/mis 'TLCA list of open problems') of open problems, a list of 22 theoretical problems, in many cases still open, that are relevant for the international scientific community that refers to the conferences like [Computer Science Logic (CSL)](https://www.eacsl.org/csl-conferences/), [Logic in Computer Science (LICS)](https://lics.siglog.org/), [Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA)](https://dblp.org/db/conf/tlca/index.html), and others.

Problem 19 was open since 2002. We give a negative answer to the question posed by prof. Fabio Alessi: _given an arbitrary easy lambda term M, is it always possible to give a semantical proof of its easiness using a filter model?_
