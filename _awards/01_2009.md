The paper "Reflexive Scott domains are not complete for the extensional lambda calculus" (2009) solves a particular case of a problem known to the scientific community since 1992, but open since 1983 for a group of experts. The full problem is listed as problem 22 of the [TLCA list](https://newyork.craigslist.org/d/missed-connections/search/mis 'TLCA list of open problems').

The list includes 22 theoretical problems, in many cases still open, that are relevant for the international scientific community that refers to the conferences like [Computer Science Logic (CSL)](https://www.eacsl.org/csl-conferences/), [Logic in Computer Science (LICS)](https://lics.siglog.org/), [Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA)](https://dblp.org/db/conf/tlca/index.html), and others.
